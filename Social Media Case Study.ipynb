    " - Evil Geniuses is a professional gaming organization. Gaming and esports in general are easily marketable to younger audiences. Although we cannot say from the given dataset alone, a simple Google search into the age demographic on social media platforms such as YouTube, TikTok, Twitter, and Instagram shows that there is a large population of young users. Creating short and consumable forms of content is very easy on these platforms. TikTok is made for generating large impressions quickly and may be the most useful in expanding outreach potential because there is already a significant audience for gaming. Look at the data on which ads and marketing strategies work for which age groups. Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. already have established ad models, so following those models may be useful if not already doing so. If a professional message is needed, then LinkedIn can be used as well. Some companies may or may not be able to market themselves on TikTok, but a professional gaming organization has access to all of these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pay attention to trends and which games are popular:\n",
    "- Valorant is a game that is very popular and is consistently one of the top streaming games on Twitch. In the dataset, there were only 3 games. Among those 3 Valorant had much smaller numbers which do not accurately represent how popular the game is. Looking at streaming viewership shows that more people are watching Valorant than CSGO or DOTA2 on average. Therefore, making content relevant to popular games/trends will increase the outreach potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "Use players and content creators: \n",
    "- In recent times, gaming organizations sponsoring popular streamers and personalities have become more common. Acquiring a popular streamer, player, etc. (we can just call them \"personality\") will work in the social media team's favor. If the personality already has an established following independent of the organization, then sponsoring them will introduce that following to the organization. An example of this would be when Sentinels brought in Sacy and Pancada to their Valorant team. The Sentinels social media team then posted content appealing to the Brazilian community, which introduced many Brazilian fans to Sentinels. A goal of personality is also to expand their own brand, but if they are sponsored, they will be effectively expanding the organization's brand as well (doing the social media team's work). In other words, the growth of a personality and an organization is directly proportional. \n",
    "\n",
    "Do not be afraid to experiment:\n",
    "- The dataset only shows 4 different types of campaigns. While this is a hypothetical dataset, there could be potential for more. Community engagement is very important, as the funding of esports would not be sufficient without the fans. Finding new and different ways to interact with the community creates a stronger fanbase. Twitter/IG LIVE, giveaways, podcasts, and other options can be viable options to grow an online presence. "
